assemble.py
================================
assemble.py is a really simple tool to stitch together header/body/footer components into a set of static pages. Im currently generating static files for a client which will be delivered as a set. Though just because they will be delivered as a set of static pages doesnt mean I need to be willing to give up modular development. This way I can still set up shared 'templates' to retain modular development practices.

Configure the assembly by changing the global options at the beginning of assemble.py. Yeah very KISS.

TODO
================================

DONE
================================
- Create build tool to combine header / footer w/ various page bodies
